# Know your systems

## Motivation
Any meaningful change to life begin with an honest examination of the current situation.

## How did I fail?
* Doing too much at the same time
  * Attention is a limited resource
  * Changing the way I am doing things (often it works quite well)
  * Example of over ambitious
* Lack of clarity and focus
* Using someone else's system
  * They work for them
  * They are the final form that works for them
  * See doing too much
  * Identity is an important thing
* No regular follow ups
* Requires will power
* Did not derive pleasure using them

## What I want
* Systems that make doing the right thing easy and wrong thing hard
* Minimum will power involvement
* Enjoyable doing them
* Do one easy thing at a time
  * Think hard, so that I do easy
* Does not require large time chunk. 30Min max
  * I cannot afford to have a personal retreat
* Focus on the most import thing present
* Keep current good habits

## Why the Agile Approach
* I learnt them at work and church
* They work
