# Battle Plan when You are Fired

Working in startups is fulfilling and rewarding but not without risks.
With my second child on the way, the thought of losing my job hurts my
sleep sometimes. To deal with this real fear, I decided to write a
plan to enact when I am fired.

I feel calmer after writing the plan out and it seems less scary.
Somehow I also feel more thankful in the moment. Part of me also is
looking forward for this special time of my life.

## Philosophy

Losing the job is an important live event. But it can also be a time
of personal growth and opportunities. A good plan will help me to be
ready when luck comes my way.
