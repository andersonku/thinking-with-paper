# Autopiloting in life gets you nowhere? Time to pick up a pen

    When we live on autopilot, it feels like someone else is driving, not us.
        -- Gustavo Razzetti

At the end of the year, it is sad to find no progress was made in life. We are stuck with the same
job, the same relationship, and even the same new year resolution. We have put efforts to change.
But when life overloads our brain, it reverts back to autopiloting and life just get back to where
it was. To get back control to our lives, we need to stop doing everything in our brain and offload
some important thinking to paper. Here is 5 ways paper can help us get out of autopilot.

## 1. Prevents overloading by tripling our working memory (if not more)

**We track more things by writing them down.** When our brain cannot keep track of things, it will
handle familiar things with autopilot. The number of things an average human can hold in short-term
memory is 7 ± 2. In contrast, most people can easily write down 20+ things on a piece of paper,
allowing us to track three times more things at a time. Anyone could easily track more objects with
paper than the best of us without. This is definitely a huge competitive advantage. The quality of
thinking is also improved by covering more ground and coping with more complexity.

## 2. Regains control from mental loops

**Writing dissipates strong emotions.** When we are angry or depressed, auto pilot kicks in. We say
the old words we always say. We do the same self-sabotaging things we always do. Our mind ruminates
and ruminates while our body just go through the motions. This is especially bad because instead of
tracking 7 ± 2 things, our brain can only track **one**. By just writing down my ruminating thought,
I am freed me from its grasp and regained my composure. The feeling is so magical you must try it.

## 3. Opens up new options

**Writing options down frees the brain to think up new options.** Going down the same path
repeatedly re-enforces autopiloting. Often times we find ourselves thinking about the same set o
things over and over again with no progress. Writing them down might break the mental barrier.
For example, everyday this month I had been thinking about what to get for my wife’s birthday.
Every time it was jewellery, books, massage, and then my brain just refused to think anymore.
It was only after penning down literally "jewellery books massage** that the idea of taking a whole
day off as a date emerges. Doing something new and different re-invigorated our long relationship.
That day became a memorable day this year. It would not happen if I did not sit down and write those
three words. It also saved me numerous painful minutes mulling over the same thing again and again.

## 4. Creates intention and intention will do magic for you

**Writing keeps us focused.** How many time have we lost our train of thought through tangent of
tangent of tangent? Writing thing down can keep us focused. Life is full of interrupts outside our
control (especially true with kids). Written words are easier to come back to then lost thoughts.
More importantly, writing things down creates 'intention' in our mind. Intention calls upon our
subconscious mind to find ideas from other seemingly irrelevant parts of our memory. Thinking can be
hard at times if our subconscious mind was thinking about different things (like what to have for
dinner). Intention turns our greatest enemy into our best helper.

## 5. Remembers it when we cannot

**We revert back to autopilot because we forget.** How devastating is it to forget the great idea
you just had (and spend minutes trying to recollect it and failed)? Paradoxically our mind can be
very creative when we are sleep deprived (or in some other mentally/physically challenging
conditions) but sleep deprivation (and similar hardships) severely disrupts our ability to commit
thoughts into long term memory. Having thoughts written down can make or break the game. Ideas could
still evaporate before you are able to pen it. Written words can recreate the mental condition for
the forgotten idea more likely to emerge again.

improve my life. Stay tuned.
