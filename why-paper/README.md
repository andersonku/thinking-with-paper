# 5 reasons why you should think with paper

I would like to argue that all serious thinking should be done with a pen and a piece of paper. Thinking with paper in hand will dramatically improve our lives for the following reasons.

## We easily triple our working memory (if not more)

The number of objects an average human can hold in short-term memory is 7 ± 2. [id] Most people can easily write down 20+ items on a piece of paper, allowing us to track down three times more objects at a time. A dumb person like me could easily track more objects with paper than the best of us without. If this is not a competitive advantage, I don't know what could be. Our thinking is covers more ground and scales with the complexity of the problem we are trying to solve.

## We get out of mental loop

Do you know people who talks in circles? Then you know how painful it is to be on the receiving side. Sometimes we do this to ourselves too without realising it. Writing things down help us uncover loop in our thinking. This is especially useful when we are ruminating over something which reduces the number of objects we can hold in our mind down to one. By just writing down my ruminating thought, I am freed me from its grasp. The feeling is so magical you must try it.

## Our thinking is more productive

Often times you find yourself thinking about the same thing over and over again but never made any progress. Writing them down could break the mental barrier. Everyday this month I had been thinking about what to get for my wife’s birthday. Every time it was jewellery, books, massage, and then my brain just refused to think anymore. It was only after penning down literally "jewellery books massage" that the idea of taking a whole day off as a date emerges. Wouldn't it be nice if I think with paper the second time I was blocked, saving me numerous painful minutes mulling over the same thing again and again.

## You create intention and intention will do magic for you

How many time have we lost our train of thought through tangent of tangent of tangent? Writing thing down can keep us focused. Life is full of interrupts outside our control. Written words are easier to come back to then electrons lost in our neural network. More importantly, writing things down creates 'intention' in our mind. Intention calls upon our subconscious mind to find ideas from other seemingly irrelevant parts of our memory. Thinking can be hard at times if our subconscious mind was thinking about different things (like what to have for dinner). Intention turns our greatest enemy into our best helper.

## We remember it when we cannot

How devastating is it to forget the great idea you just had (and spend minutes trying to recollect it and failed)? Paradoxically our mind can be very creative when we are sleep deprived (or in some other mentally/physically challenging conditions) but sleep deprivation (and similar hardships) severely disrupts our ability to commit thoughts into long term memory. Having thoughts written down can make or break the game. Ideas could still evaporate before you are able to pen it. Written words can recreate the mental condition for the forgotten idea more likely to emerge again.
