# Battle Plan for Cold or Flu

Ever wonder why the Germans kick asses in the 19th Century? One factor
could be the General Staff [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_General_Staff]
-- an agency that does nothing but creating battle plans at peace
time. When opportunity arises, they can just dust of the plan and do
it before anyone else can react. It worked so well that most country
copied and follow suit.

The average person gets 200 colds in his or her lifetime. When you are
hit with headache, blocked nose, and constant cough, deciding how to
take care of your body can be really difficult. Most of the time I
resort to the path of least resistance and some times it can be
counter-productive. Once I binged watch House of Card until 3 am. With
a two year old in day care, I only have the time between 9 to 5 to
tend myself and time flies fast.

So after recovering from a severe flu, I realised why don't I sit down
and create myself a plan to follow when I am sick. Below is my
annotated plan:

## Pantry items:

Make sure to have these items in stock. Their use will be apparent
later.

[ ] Canned sardine / tuna / your favourite fish
[ ] Canned beans -> Check salt and sugar content
[ ] Masks

## Day before

I found myself spending a few hours running errand during sick leave
days. Deciding what to buy while inhaling air full of bacteria and
viruses in poor ventilated shopping more is not the most productive
way to rest. If you know you will be sick tomorrow, why not do some
online shopping the night before so you can:

1. Have them delivered tomorrow (If you can afford it)
2. Or have them ready to pick up tomorrow
3. Or at least know what to get so you minimise shopping time.

Shopping list (Their use will be apparent later):
[ ] Lemon
[ ] Ginger
[ ] Nashi
[ ] Vitamin C supplement
[ ] Zinc supplement or your favourite immune boost
[ ] Nice Tissue
[ ] Orange
[ ] Chicken Drumstick
[ ] Chicken carcass
[ ] Garlic
[ ] Onion
[ ] Celery
[ ] Wholemeal pasta
[ ] Epsom Salt
[ ] Essential oil

## On the day

### Upon waking up
[ ] Ask for leave
[ ] Set out of office
In case of emergency, people can to contact someone else to handle
it. Sometime this also spares you from fighting the fire when you
are back to work.
[ ] Turn off work email/IM notifications
Don't create unnecessary stress. If you can't act on it, what's the
use of bad news. The top priority now is to recover.
[ ] Eat healthy breakfast
You would want a healthy mix of fiber, protein, good fat, and good carb
. If no one can make your healthy breakfast:
 [ ] Canned bake bean
 [ ] Canned sardine (Keep at home)
You probably lost part of your sense of smell and taste. Why not use
this opportunity to eat something healthy but yucky?
[ ] Supplements -- Vitamin C and Immune boost stuff
Get it over with so you don't have to remember. Historically I only
remember to take them 50% of the time.
[ ] Gargle with salt water
[ ] Change bed sheet and pillow cover
Make lying on the bed enticing. Ask nicely if your better half can do
it if possible. Also this is good signal to self that today is about
rest.
[ ] Turn on A cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier
[ ] Use your essential oil
[ ] Place a full jar of water and a cup next to your bed
[ ] Meditate for 10 mins
[ ] Go back to bed and rest

### Morning
[ ] Wear your mask and go to Clovelly Beach for an easy walk in
    sunshine with some salt air
[ ] Pick up grocery ordered last night on the way home
[ ] Prepare healthy lunch -- Cook chicken soup
1. Throw in
 * Chicken drumsticks
 * Sliced ginger
 * Pealed garlic
 * Roughly chopped onion
 * Roughly chopped celery
 * Salt
 * Pepper
 * Wholemeal pasta
2. Bring to boil
3. Turn heat to min and simmer
[ ] If I am addicted to caffeine, consume coffee/tea now
To avoid withdraw and allow the body to process them before I go to
bed at night. People to recommend against caffeine because they cause
dehydration. Drink more water to mitigate.
[ ] Go back to bed and listen to stories or Podcast
 * Myth and legends

## Afternoon
[ ] Eat the lunch prepared
[ ] Make peppermint or chamomile tea
[ ] Go back to bed and listen to stories or Podcast
[ ] Wake up and pick up my kid and pretend everything is alright.

## Do
* Drink lots of water
  * Soup
  * Tea
* Sleep early

## Don't
  * Go to places with lots of people. get infected with other stuff
  * Eat sugary

I will put this to a test the next time I am sick and review and refine
it.
